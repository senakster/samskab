        "header": "Purpose of the Project",
        "p1": "The project challenges the notion that the green transition takes place primarily through individual behavior and technological change by pointing out that it can take place just as much as a fundamental social change involving neighboring communities. The project contributes knowledge and tools that can support the establishment of completely new green neighborhood communities as well as the transition from gray housing associations to green neighborhood communities and thereby strengthen the green transition. Gray housing associations are referred to here as housing associations that do not have a direct focus on the environment, climate and sustainability, while green neighboring communities are defined as green, where their members share the desire to live more sustainably and act together on this desire."

        "header": "ABOUT THE PROJECT",
        "p1": "The project ‘SAMSKAB: From gray housing associations to green neighboring communities’ runs from 2022 to 2025 and is supported with a grant of DKK 6,413,993 from the VELUX FOUNDATION'S HUMpraxis program. The program supports projects that combine humanities research and practice with a focus on social and environmental sustainability.",
        "p2": "The project is a collaboration between four core partners (<1>University of Copenhagen</1>, <3>Naboskab</3>, <5>Bærebo</5>, <7>Omstilling Nu</7>). In addition, the project involves municipalities, housing organizations and other actors within green transformation in the housing sector.</0>",
        "p3": "In addition to Associate Professor and Project Manager <1>Quentin Gausset</1>, Assistant Professor <3>Simon Westergaard Lex</3>, Department of Anthropology, and Professor <5>Jens Villiam Hoff</5>, Department of Political Science, will participate.",
        "p4": "In addition, a PhD student will be attached to the project, who with Tingbjerg as a case will investigate how an exposed residential area can develop green neighboring communities and ultimately create a more socially balanced and attractive neighborhood.",
        "p5": "Also read the VELUX FOUNDATION's press release: <1>HUMpraxis moves to societal challenges: From violence and drugs to sustainability</1>."
